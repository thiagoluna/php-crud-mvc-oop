# php-crud-mvc-oop
Site developed using an MVC architecture with OOP PHP  

## About   
The main purpose of this course is not how to develop CRUD functionality, but how to develop using an MVC architecture, keeping the presentation of data separate from the methods that interact with the data.  

This project was developed with Model, View and Controller folders to organize the source files and a Router.php to control the requests and de responses, conducting each request to a Controller, then to a Model, and then a response for a view.  

And we used a Singleton Design Pattern to create a Connection class to connect with MySQL database.
